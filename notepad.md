# Homepage brainstorming & experimentation

Doathons bring together diverse participants to advance open, openly, quickly. The event centers around participants(no speakers needed!), and projects on Github where collaboration, discovery and preservation are made easy. Once you've got a room booked, you're free to focus on what matters - attracting awesome participants and helping them work together.

## phrases I kinda like

Events done right.
Events done open.
Get more from your event.
You run events to educate, connect, and change the world - but the format fails you.
Don't let the format fail you.
Stop guessing what your attendees want, just give them space to find it.

## Why bother

| For Attendees  | For Organizers  |
|---|---|
| Learn by doing, not listening  | Engage & build your community, not a speakers list  |
| Break networking out of breaks  | Organize projects, not the event |
| Get motivated & helped | Leave a record of your event |
| | Lower bars to contribution |
| | Get a space, get attendees. Done. |
| Engage remotely, feel the tempo |  |

### What is a do-a-thon? (original)

It's an event centered around:
* getting things done (including documenting them), and building on what has come before
* low-fi, informal participatory programming
* encouraging remote participation, and diverse in-person participation
* inclusive activities (not just "hacking" on code) encouraged

It's also an event with a soundtrack: [listen.hatnote.com](http://listen.hatnote.com/#en,fa,ar,sa,es,de,ru,jp,zh,ko) (you can configure that).

### Why do a do-a-thon? (original)

You're bored of listening to talks and other monologues, and think it's more important to use your time to engage with others and to work together on issues you care about. You want an event format that supports that and is easy to create.

### Who can do a do-a-thon (original)

Anyone!

# Now it's your turn

# Participant quotes

> "I came with a question in mind, and left with a lot of information crowdsourced from the other participants - new friends! - as well as an analysed dataset, the results of which I continue to use today."
- Naomi Penfold @npscience

# things conference organizers often hear / know about their events but don't pay attention to

* participants get most value from attendees, usually in a few minutes of breaks
* we often don't follow up how we plan (we're too exhausted, and feel like we're done)
* the same people attend most events. The "usual crowd". They're bored.

# Participant quotes & outcomes

* Analyze all Jupyter notebooks mentioned in PubMed Central: A project started at the sprint that continues to gain stream on Github
* Sonify ongoing research: Failed to take off at the event, but shipping the issue around after yields luck!
